On a standard Ubuntu 14.10 system, you will need to install the some
additional packages to build the manual.  See the "Building from source"
section of the manual for that list.

For the Index Checker specifically, more documents can be found in the
index-checker subdirectory.

All of the Index Checker documentation can be found on a google drive directory,
at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByNy04xRyVnXZWtCUEdPQ05BLU0&usp=sharing
